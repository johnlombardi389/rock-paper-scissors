## Tools:

- JavaScript

## Overview

In this project my goal was to show what I had learned about manipulating the DOM. To do this I created a game where you can play rounds of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. A winner is determined by the first to reach 5 wins and records will be added to the page using JavaScript.

## What I Learned

- Manipulating elements through JavaScript and also using it to add content to the page
- Developed a better understanding of JavaScript functions
- Using programming principles to write cleaner code and good comments
